    // Design notes:
    //     The APIs for the iterative and quantum phase estimation algorithms are
    //     parameterized in terms of discrete-time oracles as defined in the Microsoft.Quantum.Oracles
    //     namespace. Constructing such oracle definitions can be done with operations
    //     acting on other operations, making heavy use of partial application internally.

    // E.g.:
    //     let DiscreteOracle = OracleToDiscrete(U);
    //     DiscretePhaseEstimationIteration(oracle, pow, theta, targetState, control);
    //     let datum = M(control);

    //     This design then enables providing more efficient implementations of U^m
    //     to be provided by the user for specific U, while providing a sensible
    //     "default" for operations which cannot be fast-forwarded by taking advantage
    //     of their definitions.

    //     Finally, we also ensure that quantum arguments are placed last to follow
    //     standard conventions for partial application. In particular, this allows for
    //     the discrete and continuous phase estimation iterations to be used in
    //     an allocate-op-measure pattern; we may soon want to abstract that away.
