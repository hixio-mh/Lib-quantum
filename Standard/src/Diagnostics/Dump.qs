    /// Given an operation, displays diagnostics about
    /// the operation that are made available by the current
    /// execution target.

    /// ## nQubits
    /// The number of qubits on which the given operation acts.
    /// ## op
    /// The operation that is to be diagnosed.

    /// # Example
    /// When run on the quantum simulator target, the following snippet
    /// will output the matrix
    /// $\left(\begin{matrix} 0.0 & 0.707 \\\\ 0.707 & 0.0\end{matrix}\right)$:

    /// a unitary matrix used to represent `op` is displayed.
    ///
    /// Note that, when run on simulators that admit a global phase ambiguity
    /// (e.g.: the full-state simulator), returned representations may vary
    /// up to a global phase.
    ///
    /// Similarly, the ordering of rows and columns matrix representations
    /// may vary with the conventions used by each simulator supporting this
    /// operation.
