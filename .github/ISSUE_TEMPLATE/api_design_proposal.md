<!-- 
    This template is used for suggesting or proposing modifications to the Q# standard or domain-specific
    library APIs. Don't worry if there's a section that you're unsure about; we're happy to help
    in issue comments and discussions!

    If you're interested in making broad feature suggestions, the feature request template
    may be of interest instead:

    If you are interested in suggesting language improvements or modifications,
    please see the qsharp-language repository at:

# Proposal title

## Conceptual overview

<!-- Provide a motivation for and description of your proposal here. -->

### Current status

<!-- Contrast your proposal with the current status of the Q# standard and domain-specific libraries here. -->

### User feedback

<!-- If there is specific feedback (typically other GitHub issues) that motivate your proposal, link them here along with a brief discussion of how your proposal addresses that feedback. -->

### Child issues

<!-- This section should be a bulleted list of any issues that will be resolved by a completed implementation of your proposal. Note that this section may be redundant with the previous section; that's perfectly OK. -->

## Proposal

### New and modified functions, operations, and UDTs

<!--
    This is the core of your actual proposal, and should consist of a bulleted list of changes to the Q# API surface included in your proposal, grouped by namespace.

    In writing this section, it can be helpful to draft out what API documentation would look like for your proposal, especially the /// # Example sections for each function and operation.
    For more information about writing API documentation, check out https://aka.ms/qdk/contrib/api-docs.
-->


### Modifications to style guide

<!-- Does your proposal require modifying the style guide or API design principles? If so, please list and discuss any required modifications here, as that carries a unique impact that requires separate discussion. -->

### Impact of breaking changes

<!-- If your proposal includes breaking changes beyond @Deprecated attributes, please list those changes here and their expected impact on Q# users. -->

## Examples

### Current status

<!-- As appropriate, list examples of using the current Q# API. -->

### Using proposed changes

<!-- As appropriate, list examples of using the changes included in your proposal. -->

## Relationship to Q# language feature proposals

<!-- If your proposal is related to existing Q# language proposals (see https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language), please list those proposals here along with how your proposal would change based on the outcome of those Q# language discussions. -->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- In this section, list each different alternative to your proposal as a distinct subsection, and compare the pros/cons with respect to your proposal. -->

## Open design questions and considerations

<!-- List any questions and considerations not resolved by your proposal here, so that they can be discussed and addressed during API review meetings. -->
